# MCP Notes Limitations

This document outlines the current limitations of MCP Notes v0.1.0-alpha. Understanding these limitations will help set appropriate expectations and provide context for future improvements.

## Technical Limitations

### MCP Protocol Constraints

1. **One-way Communication Model**
   - **Limitation**: The MCP protocol primarily supports one-way communication, with clients making requests and servers responding.
   - **Impact**: This limits the ability to implement true conversational features for rubber duck debugging.
   - **Workaround**: Focus on simple logging with clear prompts and structured responses.

### File System Constraints

1. **No File Locking Mechanism**
   - **Limitation**: The system does not implement file locking for concurrent access.
   - **Impact**: Potential for conflicts if multiple processes access the same files simultaneously.
   - **Workaround**: Rely on file system's atomic operations where possible and avoid concurrent writes to the same file.

2. **Path Validation**
   - **Limitation**: Current path validation could be more robust.
   - **Impact**: Potential security issues with certain path patterns.
   - **Workaround**: Avoid using special characters or path traversal sequences in file paths.

### Template System

1. **Simple String Replacement**
   - **Limitation**: Templates use simple string replacement without conditional logic.
   - **Impact**: Limited flexibility in template customization.
   - **Workaround**: Use multiple templates for different scenarios or modify templates directly.

## Performance Limitations

1. **Large Directory Searches**
   - **Limitation**: Searching large directories can be slow.
   - **Impact**: Poor performance with large note collections.
   - **Workaround**: Organize notes in smaller, more focused directories.

2. **Template Caching**
   - **Limitation**: Template caching could be more efficient.
   - **Impact**: Unnecessary file system operations in some cases.
   - **Workaround**: No specific workaround needed; performance impact is minimal for most users.

3. **Memory Usage**
   - **Limitation**: Memory usage could be optimized for large operations.
   - **Impact**: Potential memory issues with very large files.
   - **Workaround**: Split very large notes into smaller, more focused notes.

## Feature Limitations

1. **Note Categorization**
   - **Limitation**: Limited support for categorizing notes beyond basic tags.
   - **Impact**: Harder to organize notes by category or topic.
   - **Workaround**: Use directory structure and file naming conventions for organization.

2. **Metadata Tracking**
   - **Limitation**: Limited metadata support beyond basic frontmatter.
   - **Impact**: Harder to track additional information about notes.
   - **Workaround**: Include metadata in note content or use tags.

3. **Rollup Summarization**
   - **Limitation**: Basic rollup summarization without advanced categorization.
   - **Impact**: Manual effort required to organize rollups.
   - **Workaround**: Manually edit rollups after generation to add additional organization.

## Client Compatibility

1. **Claude Desktop**
   - **Limitation**: Primary client for MCP Notes, with full support for all features.
   - **Impact**: Limited client options.
   - **Workaround**: Use Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible clients.

2. **Other MCP Clients**
   - **Limitation**: May have varying levels of support for MCP features.
   - **Impact**: Some features may not work with all clients.
   - **Workaround**: Stick to Claude Desktop for full feature support.

## Future Improvements

Many of these limitations are addressed in our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and will be improved in future releases. We welcome feedback and suggestions for addressing these limitations.
