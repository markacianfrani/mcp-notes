# MCP Notes Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on preparing for the v0 alpha release of MCP Notes. This includes:

1. **Documentation Finalization**: Ensuring all documentation is complete, accurate, and up-to-date for the alpha release.

2. **Code Cleanup**: Removing test files, unused code, and ensuring a clean codebase for the release.

3. **Bug Fixes**: Addressing known issues, particularly around error handling and path validation.

4. **Release Preparation**: Creating necessary release artifacts and configuration examples.

## Recent Changes

1. **Test Files Removal**: Removed test files and directories to clean up the codebase for the alpha release.

2. **Progress Documentation Update**: Updated progress.md to reflect current status and removed outdated issues.

3. **Active Context Update**: Updated activeContext.md to focus on alpha release preparation.

4. **Bug Fixes**: Fixed issues mentioned in the progress documentation.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Create a manual test script for testing tools
   - Add more comprehensive error handling tests
   - Test with different note directory structures

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding categorization to notes
   - Explore options for metadata tracking
   - Improve rollup summarization

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Enhance error messages for better user feedback
   - Improve template customization options
   - Add more examples to documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Categorization Approach

We've been considering different approaches to note categorization:

1. **Frontmatter**: Using YAML frontmatter for metadata
   - Pros: Structured, compatible with tools like Obsidian
   - Cons: More formal, requires understanding YAML syntax

2. **Inline Tags**: Using hashtags within note content
   - Pros: Simple, familiar to users
   - Cons: Can clutter content, less structured

3. **Section Headers**: Using markdown headers for categorization
   - Pros: Clean, visible in rendered markdown
   - Cons: Less flexible, harder to query programmatically

4. **Separate Metadata**: Storing metadata in separate files
   - Pros: Keeps notes clean, highly flexible
   - Cons: More complex implementation, potential sync issues

Current decision: Focus on simplifying the existing implementation before adding categorization features.

### Conversation vs. Logging

We've been discussing the balance between conversational features (rubber ducking) and simple logging:

1. **Conversational Approach**:
   - Pros: More interactive, better for problem-solving
   - Cons: More complex, limited by MCP protocol constraints

2. **Simple Logging**:
   - Pros: Frictionless, straightforward implementation
   - Cons: Less helpful for problem exploration

Current decision: Maintain the simple logging approach for now, as it aligns better with MCP protocol limitations and provides immediate value.

### Template Customization

We're considering how to handle template customization:

1. **User-Editable Templates**: Allow users to edit templates directly
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility
   - Cons: Potential for breaking changes

2. **Configuration-Based**: Use configuration options to customize templates
   - Pros: More controlled, less error-prone
   - Cons: Less flexible

Current decision: Start with user-editable templates for maximum flexibility, with clear documentation on template variables and structure.

## Implementation Challenges

1. **MCP Protocol Limitations**: The one-way communication model of MCP makes implementing true conversational features challenging.

2. **File System Concurrency**: Ensuring safe concurrent access to note files without implementing complex locking mechanisms.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring the server works consistently across different operating systems and file systems.

4. **Error Recovery**: Implementing robust error recovery to prevent data loss in case of failures.

## Current Priorities

1. **Alpha Release**: Preparing all necessary components for the v0 alpha release.

2. **Documentation**: Finalizing comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

3. **Code Quality**: Ensuring clean, well-organized, and maintainable code.

4. **Stability**: Addressing known issues to provide a reliable alpha release.
