# MCP Notes Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

MCP Notes exists to solve several common challenges faced by developers and knowledge workers:

1. **Capturing Fleeting Thoughts**: Valuable insights and ideas often occur during focused work but are easily lost if not captured immediately. MCP Notes provides a frictionless way to log these thoughts without disrupting workflow.

2. **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explaining problems to someone else (or something else, like a rubber duck) often leads to solutions. MCP Notes serves as an always-available rubber duck that can help users think through problems.

3. **Knowledge Management**: Important learnings and insights are scattered across chat logs, documents, and personal notes. MCP Notes centralizes this knowledge in a searchable, organized system.

4. **Daily Reflection**: Without structured reflection, it's easy to lose track of accomplishments and insights. The rollup feature encourages daily reflection and organization of thoughts.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Context Switching**: Traditional note-taking requires switching applications or contexts, disrupting flow. MCP Notes integrates directly with Claude Desktop, minimizing context switching.

2. **Information Overload**: Without categorization and summarization, notes become overwhelming. MCP Notes helps organize information into meaningful categories.

3. **Knowledge Loss**: Valuable insights are often forgotten if not properly captured and organized. MCP Notes ensures these insights are preserved and retrievable.

4. **Isolation During Problem-Solving**: Developers often need someone to talk through problems with. MCP Notes provides a rubber duck function that can be accessed anytime.

## How It Should Work

The user experience should be:

1. **Immediate Capture**: Users should be able to quickly log thoughts with minimal friction, directly from Claude Desktop or other MCP clients.

2. **Chronological Organization**: Notes are automatically organized by date in daily logs, creating a timeline of thoughts and insights.

3. **Categorical Summaries**: At the end of the day, notes are synthesized into categories (achievements, insights, action items) to provide a structured view of the day's work.

4. **Searchable Archive**: All notes should be easily searchable by content, date, or category.

5. **Flexible Access**: Notes should be accessible both through MCP clients and directly as markdown files in the file system.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Frictionless**: Capturing notes should require minimal effort and not disrupt the user's workflow.

2. **Unobtrusive**: The system should stay out of the way until needed.

3. **Reliable**: Users should trust that their notes are safely stored and easily retrievable.

4. **Insightful**: The rollup feature should provide valuable insights and organization, not just regurgitate the day's notes.

5. **Adaptable**: The system should work with the user's existing tools and workflows, not force them into a new paradigm.

## Integration Points

1. **Claude Desktop**: Primary interface for capturing notes and generating rollups.

2. **File System**: Notes stored as markdown files for easy access and portability.

3. **Text Editors**: Notes can be edited directly in any text editor that supports markdown.

4. **Version Control**: Markdown files can be version-controlled using Git or other VCS.
