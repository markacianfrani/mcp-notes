First call the the /today_files tool to get the list of files created or modified today. Then take the list of files and analyze them to create a structured analysis of the day's activities. Sort into sections for Accomplishments and Insights: 1. Accomplishments should be a short general list of the work done in the day so that it can answer the question "what did you do all day?" 2. Insight should be considered long-term storage. Things like new knowledge gained. Next, call the /format-for-rollup tool. It expects `achievements` and `insights` as input parameters.
